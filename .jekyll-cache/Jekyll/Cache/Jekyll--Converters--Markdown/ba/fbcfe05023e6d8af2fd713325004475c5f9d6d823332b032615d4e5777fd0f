I"û<p>I have had an opportunity to get interviewed at couple of companies.
Many companies prefer pre knowledge of tools like Spring-Boot, AWS and other concepts. 
Whereas some companies prefer techniques like problem solving ability, thinking ability and approach one takes.
So I would say, do check out about the some previous interviews taken at company you are targeting. 
I have faced questions on both tools and techniques overall in my interviews.
I would say work on DSA more and get better at it.</p>

I"±<p>My experience at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">Masai School</a> has been a knowledgeable and career boosting experience.
In 6 months, I have learned a lot of things related to technology and the Digital world.
I got a chance to strengthen my <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Data Structures and Algorithms part</a>.
Which helped me in solving interesting problems.</p>

<p>As I was part of the part time batch, so I had classes from 7pm to 9pm on weekdays. I have learnt a lot from these classes ,especially DSA part. 
On Wednesday and Saturday we had TA session with our mentors. 
I had a great time in the sessions with my TA Lohit Marodia.</p>

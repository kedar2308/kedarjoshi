My experience at [Masai School][1] has been a knowledgeable and career boosting experience.
In 6 months, I have learned a lot of things related to technology and the Digital world.
I got a chance to strengthen my [Data Structures and Algorithms part][2].
Which helped me in solving interesting problems.

As I was part of the part time batch, so I had classes from 7pm to 9pm on weekdays. I have learnt a lot from these classes ,especially DSA part. 
On Wednesday and Saturday we had TA session with our mentors. 
I had a great time in the sessions with my TA Lohit Marodia.
